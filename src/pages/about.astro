      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
        <p>
          The Industrial Engineering Network (IE Network) is an organization
          founded to create cooperation and mutual understanding between
          educational institutions that produce industrial engineering
          professionals and organizations engaged in industrial engineering
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Established in October 1982 with support from the Engineering
          Institute of Thailand (EIT), the IE Network has the primary objective
          of supporting the exchange of information and knowledge in industrial
          engineering work. The network facilitates collaborative research
          projects and cooperates with various organizations in developing
          industrial engineering work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the IE Network has more than 40 member institutions throughout
          Thailand and has been organizing academic activities for more than 20
          years to support both the educational sector and the industrial
          business community. Notably, the network conducts the IE Network
          Conference annually, which has become a significant venue for
          exchanging research findings and promoting the practical application
          of research results.
